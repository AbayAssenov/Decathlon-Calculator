# Decathlon-Calculator
Decathlon is a combined event in athletics with ten events. Events are usually competed on two consecutive days on track or field. Each event is scored according to a point system and points achieved determine the winner. The point system is based on the result not the position in the event. Scoring over 9000 points is really rear and has been done only a few times. The list for the best results all time is available on IAAF's site. 


This calculator allows you to calculate decathlon score.
